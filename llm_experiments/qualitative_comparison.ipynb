      "An alternative route for a high-speed rail project has been proposed by critics of HS2, which would use the former Great Central Line that was closed in the 1960s. The proposal suggests reopening the line, which ran from London to Nottingham with connections to Leeds and Manchester, at a cost of £6billion, significantly lower than the £42.6 billion estimated for the HS2 project. Supporters argue that reopening the Great Central Railway would address environmental concerns and have the support of major retailers eager to transport goods via rail.

      "critics of the hs2 rail project have put forward an alternative route using a train line which was closed in the 1960s. the rival scheme would see the reopening of the former great central line, which ran from london to nottingham, with links to leeds and manchester. supporters of the proposal claim it would cost around £6billion, instead of the £42.6 billion which the hs2 project is set to cost. rival scheme: hs2 critics have put forward an alternative route using the former great central line, which ran from london to nottingham and was closed in the 1960s . kelvin hopkins, the labour mp for luton north, has joined leading supermarket groups and hauliers to draw up plans to reopen the disused line. mr hopkins said reopening the great central railway would avoid many of the environmental concerns associated with hs2. ‘it could be built for £6billion, a fraction of what hs2 would cost, and it avoids all the environmental problems,’ he told the sunday telegraph. ‘we have a very precise route, we have been working on it for a very long time and we are carefully trying to get political support. ‘tesco, sainsbury’s and marks & spencer are desperate to get more of their goods on rail and they have written letters backing this scheme. axed: the southern section of the great central railway was closed in 1966 by dr richard beeching . ‘hs2 is clearly a white elephant, but the problem is that when governments announce something they find it difficult to back down.’ axed by dr richard beeching, the southern section of the great central railway has been closed since 1966. its express trains ran from london to rugby, leicester, nottingham, sheffield and leeds, with a branch to manchester. supporters of the plan say that since much of the infrastructure still exists, the disruption to local residents caused by rebuilding the line would be substantially less than a new railway. ‘so much of the railway still exists, and it would be billions of pounds cheaper to build than hs2,’ said brian holyland, a member of the great central railway society who worked on the line before it was closed.\n"

      "of all the celebrations planned for the queen’s diamond jubilee, it is perhaps the most fitting. stunning jewels created from the largest diamond ever found are to be collected together in public for the first time in a unique exhibition at buckingham palace. they include a brooch containing gems weighing 94.4 carats and 63.3 carats and another heart-shaped piece featuring an 18.8 carat jewel. diamond queen: her majesty wears the imperial state crown and holds the sovereign's sceptre, both of which contain stones cut from the cullinan diamond in this picture from her coronation... crown jewels: the two largest cuts from the cullinan diamond were set into the sovereign's sceptre, left, and the imperial state crown, right . cullinan iii and iv brooch: the third and fourth largest of the gems - a pear-shaped drop of 94.4 carats (iii) and the cushion-shaped 63.3 carat iv - were originally placed by queen mary on her new crown in 1911. the stones were most often worn hooked together as a pendant brooch.. cullinan vi and vii brooch: many pieces of royal jewellery were created to be versatile. as well as the brooch, the 11.5 carat cullinan vi has been used in a number of pieces including a diadem. cullinan viii can be set with the five other numbered cullnan stones into a radiating platinum mount . cullinan v brooch this heart-shaped stone weighs 18.8 carats and is mounted in a fine radiating platinum web with a scrolling millegrain and pave-set border of brilliant diamonds. the mounting of the jewel was designed to be as adaptable as possible and was most often worn by queen mary (and now by the queen) as a brooch.it also forms the detachable centre section of the diamond and emerald stomacher made for queen mary for the delhi durbar in 1911 and has been worn suspended from the cullinan viii brooch . all the items – worn regularly by the queen over the past six decades – use gems cut from the incomparable cullinan diamond. and the priceless collection’s history is all the more incredible given the history behind the stone. when the diamond was mined in 1905, it looked nothing more than a worthless crystal – so much so that the manager of the premier mine near pretoria, south africa, threw it out as rubbish. it was only on closer inspection that staff were persuaded the piece of rock could be a genuine diamond. in fact it turned out to be three times larger than anything discovered before. cullinan ix the smallest of the nine stones, weighing 4.4 carats, was set into a platinum ring for queen mary in 1911. the pear shape is known as a pendeloque and is mounted in an openwork 12-claw setting. it was also inherited by the queen in 1953. largest of its kind: a glass model replica of the cullinan diamond in its original rough state . precious: the diamond was also cut to produce this cullinan iii and iv brooch, commissioned by queen mary in 1911, and the delhi durbar necklace and cullinan pendant . weighing 3,106 carats in its rough state and measuring 4in by 2.5in by 2.12in, the cullinan – named after the chairman of the mining company, thomas cullinan – was also exceptional for its blue-white colour and purity. soon after it was found, it was sent to buckingham palace for inspection by king edward vii. for two years the stone remained a public wonder, but it was hard to find a buyer as there were doubts a stone so big could ever be cut. eventually, the prime minister of the transvaal – then a british colony – suggested his government should acquire the cullinan and present it to edward vii as a token of loyalty. in 1907 the uncut stone was brought to sandringham house in norfolk. dazzling collection: the coronation necklace and earrings, worn by the queen on her coronation in 1953, left, and right, the south africa necklace and bracelet, a gift from the government of south africa to the then princess elizabeth on her 21st birthday. these gems were not cut from the cullinan diamond, but will be among those displayed at buckingham palace this summer . fit for a queen: this small diamond crown, as worn by queen victoria for her official diamond jubilee portrait in 1870, will also go on display. made by garrard, the crown was not made from the cullinan diamond . ... she has worn the imperial state crown throughout her 60-year reign on occasions such as the state opening of parliament . 'granny's tiara': the queen's favourite tiara, given to her from her grandmother, queen mary, will be in the exhibition. here, she is pictured wearing it in on state visits in 2011, left, and 1989, right . passed down the generations: the queen as a child, left, with her mother who wore the imperial state crown before her, and, right,  her grandmother queen mary who can be seen wearing one of the cullinan diamonds as a brooch . cutting the stone was entrusted to the celebrated firm of ij asscher of amsterdam. it was too large to be cut into a single gem, so cleaving – or sawing – was necessary. the girls of great britain tiara was a wedding present to princess victoria mary of teck, later queen mary - the queen’s grandmother - on behalf of the girls of great britain and ireland in 1893. made by jewellers garrard and originally crafted with upright pearls around the top and a bandeau base, it was altered in 1920 by queen mary, who replaced the pearls with diamonds and removed the base. it is one of the queen’s favourites and is forever known as 'granny’s tiara', being a wedding present from her grandmother in 1947. it is said to be very light and easy to wear. the first blow broke the knife and the diamond remained intact. a second attempt split it in two. eight months of grinding and polishing followed, with the result of  nine principal numbered stones, 96 small brilliants and nine carats of unpolished fragments. the total weight of the gems cut from the cullinan was 1,055.8 carats. in 1909 the two largest gems – the biggest colourless and flawless cut diamonds in the world – were formally presented to king edward vii at windsor castle and were eventually set at the head of the sovereign’s sceptre and in the imperial state crown. both are on display at the tower of london and will not be in the new exhibition. the other seven were mounted for queen alexandra and queen mary – the king’s wife and daughter-in-law – to create some of the most dazzling pieces of jewellery in the royal collection. now those jewels are to be shown together for the first time. the seven stones are contained in five pieces of jewellery. a brooch containing two stones – the 94.4 carat cullinan iii and 63.3 carat cullinan iv; a second heart-shaped brooch containing cullinan v, which weighs 18.8 carats; the delhi durbar necklace from which cullinan vii hangs in a pendant; a third brooch containing cullinan vi and cullinan viii; and a platinum ring featuring the smallest of the nine stones, 4.4 carat cullinan ix. experts said last night that the value of the cullinan diamond was impossible to calculate as there has never been a gem like it in terms of size, clarity and colour. the jewellery made from it is equally ‘priceless’, not least due to its impeccable royal provenance. however, based on a 250 carat diamond that is currently for sale at an estimated £500,000 per carat, the jewellery could be worth anything from £78million for the cullinan iii and iv brooch, £9.4million for the cullinan v brooch, £4.4million for  the cullinan vii, £5.7million for the cullinan vi and viii and £2.2million for the cullinan ix. prince william has confided how he found out that you ‘don’t mess’ with the queen. the prince makes the remark in an interview with us broadcaster abc to be shown to mark the jubilee. ‘as i learnt from growing up, you don’t mess with your grandmother,’ he said. history in the making: joseph asscher makes the first cut into the cullinan diamond in february 1908 - the first blow broke the knife . the cullinan diamond, which weighed 3,106 carats in its rough state, was first discovered in 1905 at a mine near pretoria in south africa. it was so large that its finders thought it must be crystal so threw it away. when its worth was realised, it was recovered and sent to london to be inspected by king edward vii at buckingham palace. for two years it remained unsold as it was thought to be too big to cut. in 1907, the prime minister of the transvaal suggested that his government should acquire the cullinan and present it to king edward vii as a gift. under police protection, the uncut stone was conveyed to sandringham house in norfolk, where the king was celebrating his 66th birthday. the task of cutting the stone was entrusted to the celebrated firm of ij asscher of amsterdam. after weeks of consideration, including four days spent making the groove into which the steel cleaving knife was to be inserted, the stone was ready to be split - but the first blow broke the knife. once cut, grinding and polishing followed, with three polishers working 14 hours a day. eventually, they produced nine principal numbered stones, 96 small brilliants and nine carats of unpolished fragments. in 1909, the two largest gems were formally presented to king edward vii at windsor castle. these are the two largest colourless and flawless cut diamonds in the world. the biggest - the great star of africa - was set in the sovereign’s sceptre and the second gem - the second star of africa - was set in the imperial state crown. both are on now display at the tower of london. the other seven were all mounted by garrard’s or carrington’s in a brooches, a ring and a necklace and have been worn by members of the royal family on state occasions. in 2012, seven of the nine stones will go on display in buckingham palace in a special exhibition to celebrate queen elizabeth ii's diamond jubilee . the diamonds: a jubilee celebration exhibition will be held from june 30 to july 8 and from july 31 to october 7 .\n"

      "a british prisoner’s secret diary telling an epic story of love, survival and adultery in a second world war internment camp has been discovered and returned to his daughter nearly 70 years after it was thought to have been destroyed. civil servant raymond jones risked death by keeping a meticulous record of daily life in hong kong’s stanley camp where some 2,800 mostly british civilians were held from 1942 until 1945 after japan invaded the former colony. the neat pencil strokes of newly married jones, whose pregnant wife marjorie was evacuated as japanese troops closed in on hong kong, detail the war’s progress, the struggle to survive inside the brutal camp – and a passionate affair he had with a fellow internee. memento: the only surviving wedding photograph of raymond jones and wife marjorie . throughout the war, raymond, from skegness, lincolnshire, bravely kept a union jack hidden inside his mattress and was hailed a hero when he was allowed to hoist it above stanley camp watched by allied troops and hundreds of fellow camp survivors following the japanese surrender. then, soon after he arrived home in britain at the end of the war to join marjorie and daughter rae, a parcel arrived from his lover –  a nurse called gwen flower – with a letter telling besotted raymond to forget about her and begin a new life with his family. but it was marjorie who opened the letter and then read the diary. heartbroken and angry, she tore up their wedding photos and the letters they had exchanged during the war and ordered raymond to destroy the diary. flag day: raymond jones proudly hoisting the union jack he kept stitched inside his mattress at the stanley camp when it was liberated after the japanese surrender . their marriage survived and – although raymond pined for his lover – they returned to hong kong where they had a second daughter, diana, and raymond worked until 1957 when he was  diagnosed with cancer and returned to britain where he died. marjorie lived until 1985 and went to her grave telling her daughters her greatest regret was destroying the diary, which provided a unique record of life as a civilian war prisoner. but now, in a remarkable twist,  the diary has been returned to raymond’s daughter, rae shaw, a 72-year-old grandmother. it was discovered in scotland in 2010 by alison mcewan, the daughter of another hong kong civil  servant, as she sorted through papers and books left by her father, who died in the mid-1980s. alison recognised its significance and tried to trace rae, who is mentioned  lovingly throughout. when she failed to find her, she sent the diary to hong kong where it was put on display in a museum on the site of the former prison camp. rae learned of the diary’s existence when she was playing with a new ipad her grandson had helped her buy. she entered her name and ‘hong kong’ into an internet search engine to see if there was any record of her childhood in the far east. it was then she saw a reference to the r. e. jones war diary in hong kong. the letter ‘e’ refers to raymond’s middle name, eric. when stunned rae got in touch with the museum, the authorities copied the pages for display, released the original and sent it to rae’s home in nottingham. ‘i just tapped ‘‘rae marjorie jones hong kong’’ on my ipad and up popped this list – and at the top of it were the words ‘‘r. e. jones war diary’’,’ explained rae, a widow. ‘i shall never forget that moment. i froze. it was a feeling of shock – pure shock. and everything that has happened since has been so emotional and exciting and wonderful. how the diary survived the row between raymond and marjorie is  a mystery. ‘my mother described the destruction of the diary as her biggest regret. that is what we have lived with since,’ rae said. wartime record:the diary kept by raymond jones detailing everyday life in stanley camp . ‘after the war, gwen sent my father a parcel containing an atlas, which i still have. my mother opened the parcel, and it contained this ‘‘dear john’’ letter which she read. she was totally shocked and horrified and heartbroken. ‘they had this massive row where she ripped up all their wedding photographs and all the letters that had passed between them during the war. mummy said everything was destroyed, including the diary. ‘i was only five at the time and i don’t remember the argument. i can only envisage a huge row. i imagine my father said, ‘‘i’ll go and burn the bloody thing,’’ and went off with the diary, but didn’t burn it and she just assumed he had.’ rae believes her father secretly sent the diary to alison’s father, colin mcewan – who, like raymond, served in the royal naval volunteer reserve in hong kong – or gave it to a fellow internee who later passed it to mcewan. ‘my father never once mentioned the diary and he obviously never mentioned it to my mother to spare her any more misery,’ she said. the diary – by turns fascinating, mundane and mildly scandalous – records the daily hardships, deaths and the price of black-market goods inside the prison camp. it also tells of rumours that were circulating about the war’s progress in europe and the pacific. raymond writes lovingly of marjorie and daughter rae, particularly on their birthdays and at christmas, before his romance with gwen – referred to as g – blossoms in the dying months  of the war, leaving him torn between family life and his lover as he  heads home. joyous day: stanley camp, which held mostly british civilians from 1942 to 1945 . in a touching entry for january 22, 1942, he writes, clearly with his wife in mind: ‘well darling, our rae is 12 months old and i sincerely hope and pray that this, her first birthday, will be the first and last that we are parted until she leaves us to start a home of her own. i hope you had a nice little party sweetheart, with one candle on the cake. god bless you both.’ but the horrors of war are never far from his mind. on july 13, 1942, he says: ‘canton bombed last night. hong kong blockaded.’ and in another entry a year later, he describes the dreadful conditions in the camp: ‘joint protest being signed by all adult internees. it deals with all the problems that are becoming more acute daily: poor food, lack of drugs and medicines; the increase of diseases caused through malnutrition; the inadequacy of canteen supplies and money.’ during raymond’s time in the prison camp, seven internees were tortured in front of fellow prisoners and later executed for possessing a radio set they used to pass messages in and out of the camp. many other prisoners died of illnesses linked to malnutrition. surrender: general douglas macarthur, left, and lt. gen. richard k. sutherland, centre, watching japanese foreign minister manoru shigemitsu marking japan's formal surrender to alllied forces on september 2, 1945 . after the japanese surrender,  rae lived with the painful fallout of the affair for the remainder of her otherwise idyllic childhood growing up in hong kong. a gregarious character before the war, raymond was morose and withdrawn afterwards. she said: ‘as i was growing up, my mother would say, ‘‘darling, he wasn’t always like this,’’ ’ said rae. ‘people who knew him before the war say he was a charming, witty, loving man, but that is completely the opposite of the man i knew. ‘he was difficult. everything i did he picked on. i had a hard time, and i assumed it was because the lady that ended the affair had said to him, ‘‘you must stay with your wife and get to know the baby you have never met.’’ ’ rae draws comfort from the many loving references to her mother  and herself in the dairy. ‘you can see he was a very loving husband. he missed my mother terribly. he wrote to her regularly and, when i was born, he was thrilled,’ rae said. ‘he calls mum darling marj and me baby rae and on my birthday he talks about me. so it tells me that  he was a normal, young married man, and that he changed.’ the war in hong kong: british troops being made to march during a chinese victory parade . younger sister diana, who was just six when her father died, said: ‘mummy regretted destroying the letters and wedding photographs but she was clearly heartbroken at the time. she would be delighted that the diary survived. ‘mummy said if she could have  the time over again, she would do exactly the same – she clearly loved him very much.’ despite the rift her affair with raymond triggered, rae and her  sister are keen to trace the family of gwen flower. ‘diana and i wonder where she is,’ she said. ‘because of what she did, our lives have been different to what they would otherwise have been. we wish we knew what happened to her, and we hope she found happiness.’\n"
